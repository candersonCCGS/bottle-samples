# Bottle Samples
This repository contains sample web applications built using Python and the Bottle framework.

Some of the projects are simple web app, while others use a SQLite database for the backend and return the results of various queries.

To use the sample databases:

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Clone the repository and save it to your computer
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder for the web app you want to use
4. Run the app by typing __python <app_name>__ at the command prompt in the terminal
   NOTE: Make sure you are referencing the correct version of Python and have Bottle installed
5. Open your web browser and navigate to __localhost:8080__ (or change to whatever port number your app is using)

NOTE: If the webserver starts and returns a 404: File not found error, make sure that command prompt is in the same folder as the python app file.
